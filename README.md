# Lab_06-07
Lab 6 and 7


My steps to completing lab 06
- start by calling all the dependnces of System so that you can use different files from different libraries

- then create  3 classes for me I started with a class called  Zoo inside this file I created a abstract class called Zoo with 3 different methods call AnimalSound, RestTime, and FavoriteFood that will be used later on.

- inside the Herbivorers and Predators classes I extend from the Zoo class and overrided the methods and string some that the information that is inputed in the main Program file and be passed into it and used there

- lastly inside my main file called Program I just declared some strings with information that I could pass into my new Animals instance that passes down through my classes and return information to my console.
